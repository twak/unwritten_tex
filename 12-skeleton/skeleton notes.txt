skeleton notes

fix up introduction re: WSS terminology vs PWSS vs MWSS vs NWSS etc...

we jump into the algorithm too fast. explain naive algorithm - iteratively shrinking the polygon. Also have to introduce Aicholzer's triangulation approach for complexity, so throw it in here?

huber's comments on felkel being broken: do we really not fall for this

description of why the GIE works

finding faces with weights

examples of weighted skeletons with holes? faces spliting, merging and splitting again? face finding with holes example?

illustration of GIE vs. loops of 2

bigger version of the (reflex on reflex)*a billion example?

images in mwss sectino closer to words.

mwss: remove references toloop of two. Consistency with loop of two or loop of 2.

summary of degeneracies

missing:
properties of the SS section
Aichholzer's collapsing triangle diagram.
Eppstein's motorcycle graph (?? necessary?)

Other todo:
Eppstein
